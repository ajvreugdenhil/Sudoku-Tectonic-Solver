# Sudoku-Tectonic-Solver

Quick project to prove my algorithm skills.
Puzzles are provided as a test by the MIVD.
More than a year has passed since, so I presume that presenting the solution is fair game. 

The program works by using recursion and back tracking.

First version is not optimized & doesn't have great user input.

Input is a csv file with two blocks separated by a blank line.
The first block is a grid with shape IDs. 
The second block is a grid with the given values of the squares.
